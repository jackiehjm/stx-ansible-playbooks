# This policy file defines how the Kubernetes cluster events, specified through
# rules, are logged. One of four log levels can be used: None (not logged),
# Metadata (logs only metadata without request or response), Request (logs only
# metadata and request body) and RequestResponse (logs metadata, request and
# response bodies). More information can be found in the following link:
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/.
