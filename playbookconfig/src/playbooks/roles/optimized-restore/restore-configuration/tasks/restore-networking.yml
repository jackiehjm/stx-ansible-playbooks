# SUB-TASKS DESCRIPTION:
#   Setup networking so that restoring can be completed.
#   Networking should match the state it would be in after
#   completing a typical bootstrapping, so that unlocking can
#   be performed immediately after optimized restore is complete.

# Bring up networking, meant to replicate state during boostrapping
