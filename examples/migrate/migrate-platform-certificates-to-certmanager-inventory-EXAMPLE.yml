# Parameter system_local_ca_cert will be the certificate that will be used as the
# issuer for platform certificates (registry.local, https / rest-api, oidc)
#
# Please make sure that you use a root_ca_cert and system_local_ca_cert certificate
# with a long duration. The playbook will fail if any of these CA certificates expire in
# less than 3 years.
#
# If you wish to use a different value for CA duration you can override
# it by setting a different value to validation parameter ca_duration:
# Example:
# ca_duration: 2
# Notice that ca_duration is applied to both root_ca_cert and system_local_ca_cert
#
# Please also make sure that duration and renewBefore are sensible values
# considering the system_local_ca_cert remaining duration.

    root_ca_cert: <base64_cert>
    # It's strongly recommended using an Intermediate CA for system-local-ca_cert
    # as that has the advantages of anchoring your certificates to your external Root CA.
    # However, it is possible to simply specify a Root CA for system-local-ca_cert.
    # For that, specify system_local_ca_cert and system_local_ca_key with values from your Root CA.
    # Note that system_local_ca_cert and root_ca_cert must be the same for that configuration.
    system_local_ca_cert: <base64_cert>
    system_local_ca_key: <base64_key>
    # the ca_duration parameter is optional. If not specified, it defaults to 3.
    # It represents the number of years for the CA certificates validity check.
    # It is not recommended to use short values for this parameter.
    # It applies to both system_local_ca_cert and the system_local_ca_cert certificates.
